    <h1>Muhannad's First Page</h1>
    <p>Hi, everyone! I have started working on my webpage. I understand that you want to retain the information you
        learned without forgetting, so I will do this practically to retain the information.</p>

    <section id="Education">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I passed 12th standard in 2016. I got <em>100 out of 100</em> in <strong>Maths</strong>.</p>
        <p>After that, I went to Amity to pursue B.Tech(Civil), but due to my own mistakes, I had to spend a better part of the year in and out of rehabs and after 1 year of not attending college, I dropped out.</p>

        <h2>Life After Dropping Out</h2>
        <p>I then tried to do a course in Pharmacy, but I got admission in <em><abbr title="Sir Syed Memorial">SSM</abbr></em>
            college and kinda forgot about the <strong>B.Pharma</strong> application date. <br>&nbsp;So I continued there.
            This was a very bad decision. I think it's enough for now. Later!</p>

        <h3>Life After Graduating</h3>
        <p>I am currently pursuing <abbr title="Master of Computer Application">M.C.A</abbr> from Amity University.</p>
        <p>In Amity, they use <a href="https://s.amizone.net">Amizone</a> for attendance and they are very strict about their
            attendance.</p>

    <section id="Routine">
        <h4>My Daily Routine</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>I wake up in the morning at around 8 to 9 A.M.</li>
            <li>I then smoke a cigarette.</li>
            <li>After that, I take a shower.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>I have breakfast when I wake up early.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have a brunch.</li>
            <li>College life is almost the same; it feels like I'm stuck in a loop and the condition to break the loop has
                not occurred yet, and the best part is I don't know the condition to exit the loop.</li>

            <dt><strong>Sad Story of a Boy</strong></dt>
            <dd>So this boy loved to play cricket.</dd>

            <dt><em>Why Did He Do It?</em></dt>
            <dd>It was trauma or something that happened in his childhood that made him want to escape reality.</dd>
