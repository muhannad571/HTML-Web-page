        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <p>This is some information about my life. I have had some ups and downs, but recently all I had were downs. I am not troubled as I will fight and never quit.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <section id="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction to the bad stuff</h2>
            <p>No one can say how I ended up like this, even I don't know, but here are a few points:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>My home was not an ideal place to grow as I constantly saw my parents fighting, and since I can remember, I got involved almost every time.</li>
                <li>This caused lots of problems, so I went out and made friends.</li>
                <li>This was the government's planning to destroy the youth with substances like they did in Punjab.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <hr>

        <section id="Reasons">
            <h3>Why did it happen to this degree?</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>I learned how to make my own stuff.</dt>
                <dd>As I learned about making my own stuff, I didn't need money to get high. I wanted to escape reality, and even after going to multiple rehabs, I was not ready to quit. I think I might have some brain damage. But I will work hard to make my parents proud of me.</dd>
            </dl>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section id="BlameGame">
            <h2>Who is to blame?</h2>
            <p>So I have some points about this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I used to blame everything on my parents, but now as I am growing older, I see things clearly now.</li>
                <li>My parents never wanted bad for me and warned me about the company I kept, but I didn't listen.</li>
                <li>So if anyone is to blame, it's me and no one else because I wanted to do itâ€”it felt good.</li>
                <li>So I am not playing this blame game anymore; it's my life, and I messed it up. Now I have to fix it. Please GOD help me. Give me the strength to go through this difficult time.</li>
            </ul>
